/*
 * Interface between implementation dependent toolkit and the rest of corinthia.
 *
 * This file describes the smallest possible interface, in order to facilitate easier
 * implementation of other toolkits.
 *
 * The toolkit implementation has the following responsibilities:
 * - Make all graphic manipulation and event handling
 * - Generate the main window, with buttons and a text frame (to show the actual text). Layout is in the TK.
 * - Receive and pass events from the windows/buttons/javasscripts
 * - Manipulate the buttons (enable/disable etc)
 * - Handle dialog boxes, layout is in the TK
 * - Start Javascripts on the text
 * - Provide low level call back with results
 *
 * The toolkit generic part has the following responsibilities:
 * - Provide single calls for every javascript function
 * - Provide manipulation calls (enable, focus etc) for every button
 * - Provide high level call back for each javascript function and button
 *
 * Some of the TK implementations might have a license incompatible with a Apache release, as a consequence the toolkit class
 * makes a complete seperation between the apache world, and the potential non-apache world.
 *
 * The interface consist of 2 classes (each singletons)
 * the toolkit class is instanciated in Layer1 (in the individual implementations) and called from generic Layer1 to
 * activate actions.
 *
 * The toolkit_callback class is instanciated in the generic Layer1 and called from the toolkit implementation to pass results
 * back to the generic layer
 */



class toolkit_callback {
    /* Callback interface
     *
     * Callbacks are always invoked *after* the execution of a particular editor library API function,
     * not during. The reason for this design design in the library was to enable support for web view
     * classes that did not provide native support for callbacks (as was the case for iOS, at least at
     * the time the library was originally written).
     *
     * The way that callbacks are invoked is that after each editor API call, a query is performed for a
     * list of pending callback messages. The evaluation logic iterates through these and invokes the
     * appropriate callback method for each. For this reason, callbacks method are all 'void' - they
     * never return a value. Callbacks are for notification purposes only - typically telling layer2
     * to update the UI in some manner.
